This website is built by IBM Skills Network, guiding you to build your very own portfolio website with the help of Streamlit and OpenAI's GPT-3 text-davinci-003 model. The best part? You don't need to be a tech whiz to get started. We're talking about combining the super-friendly interface of Streamlit with the serious firepower of OpenAI to showcase your work. 

So, why should you even consider this project? Sure, there are plenty of guides out there for creating Streamlit apps, but there's a noticeable gap when it comes to using it for crafting personal portfolio websites – let alone integrating an AI chatbot tailored to your preferences. That\'s where I come in with this step-by-step guide to fill that void. This guide provides you with a portfolio website template that's not only easy to follow but also highly customizable. You can easily revise it to showcase your own data work, achievements, and personality. Hope you will find it helpful!
